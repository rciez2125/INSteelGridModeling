Data files:

combined_gen_ann - annual electricity generation by generation technology, grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

combined_emit - annual electricity emissions by grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

Scripts:

calculating_total_emissions.ipynb - jupyter notebook that calculates the total emissions, and avoided emissions for 5 grid scenarios and 
  a specified steel electrification transition pathway. Includes a monte-carlo analysis to account for uncertainty in direct emissions
