Data files:

combined_gen_ann - annual electricity generation by generation technology, grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

combined_gen_ivrt - electricity generation by generation technology, facility, grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

combined_emit - annual electricity emissions by grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

combined_capacity_ivrt - installed generation capacity by generation technology, facility, grid balancing area, and time for all grid scenarios and steel electrification transitions considered

Scripts:

calculating_total_emissions.ipynb - jupyter notebook that calculates the total emissions, and avoided emissions for 5 grid scenarios and 
  a specified steel electrification transition pathway. Includes a monte-carlo analysis to account for uncertainty in direct emissions 

Plotting_gen_and_cap.ipynb - a jupyter notebook that makes the plots of annual generation and capacity for northern indiana for all grid scenarios and steel electrification pathways.
